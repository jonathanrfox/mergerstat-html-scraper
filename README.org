#+TITLE: Mergerstat HTML Scraper
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This package handles the extraction of data from Mergerstat HTML
documents.

* Usage

There is a single function =scrape= that takes as parameters a
filename and a dict of document components and returns a generator
yielding a dict with extracted data. The filename should be a path to
an html file. The dict of components should have keys that describe
the component and values that inherit from the abstract class
=DocumentComponent= and implement an =extract= method. There are few
classes in =document_components.py= that target main parts of the
document. See =example.py= for a working example.
